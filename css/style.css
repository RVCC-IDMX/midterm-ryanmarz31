                <h2>An Excerpt From Sherlock Holmes</h2>

                <div>

                    <p>"The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, 
                        and then he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I 
                        heard of him from New Mexico. After that came a long 
                        newspaper story about how a miners' camp had been attacked 
                        by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank's name among the 
                        killed. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months
                        after. Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the 
                        doctors in 'Frisco. Not a word of news came for a year and 
                        more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. 
                        Then Lord St. Simon came to 'Frisco, and we came to London, 
                        and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, 
                        but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would
                        ever take the place in my heart that had been given to
                        my poor Frank.</p>

                    <p>"Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I'd 
                        have done my duty by him. We can't command our love, but 
                        we can our actions. I went to the altar with him with 
                        the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was 
                        in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just 
                        as I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw 
                        Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew. 
                        I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked 
                        again there he was still, with a kind of question in his 
                        eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see 
                        him. I wonder I didn't drop. I know that everything was
                        turning round, and the words of the clergyman were 
                        just like the buzz of a bee in my ear. I didn't know 
                        what to do. Should I stop the service and make a scene 
                        in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed 
                        to know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger 
                        to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him 
                        scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that he was
                        writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out 
                        I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the 
                        note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. 
                        It was only a line asking me to join him when he made 
                        the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for 
                        a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined
                        to do just whatever he might direct.</p>

                    <p>"When I got back I told my maid, who had known him 
                        in California, and had always been his friend. I 
                        ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things 
                        packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have 
                        spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard 
                        before his mother and all those great people. I just 
                        made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards. 
                        I hadn't been at the table ten minutes before I saw 
                        Frank out of the window at the other side of the road. 
                        He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park. 
                        I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some 
                        woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon 
                        to me--seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a 
                        little secret of his own before marriage also--but I managed 
                        to get away from her and soon overtook Frank. We got 
                        into a cab together, and away we drove to some lodgings 
                        he had taken in Gordon Square, and that was my true wedding 
                        after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a prisoner 
                        among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to 'Frisco, found 
                        that I had given him up for dead and had gone to England, 
                        followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the very 
                        morning of my second wedding."</p>

                    <p>"I saw it in a paper," explained the American. 
                        "It gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived."</p>

                    <p>"Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank 
                        was all for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that 
                        I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any 
                        of them again--just sending a line to pa, perhaps, to show 
                        him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think of all 
                        those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table 
                        and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes 
                        and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be 
                        traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find 
                        them. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, 
                        only that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this 
                        evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he 
                        showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank 
                        was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong 
                        if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking 
                        to Lord St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his 
                        rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very 
                        sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think 
                        very meanly of me."</p>

                    <p>Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, 
                        but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip 
                        to this long narrative.</p>
